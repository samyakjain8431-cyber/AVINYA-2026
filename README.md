# 🚨 AVINYA

### Community-Assisted Emergency Response Platform

> **When every second matters, help should be closer than you think.**

AVINYA is a community-assisted emergency response platform designed to connect people facing emergencies with nearby **verified responders** who can provide immediate assistance while professional emergency services are on the way.

Built as a **Smart India Hackathon 2026 MVP**.

**Status:** 🚧 MVP / Hackathon Prototype

# 🎯 The Problem

During an emergency, the first few minutes can be critical.

A bystander may report an incident to emergency services, but professional help may take time to arrive. At the same time, **capable people may already be nearby** but have no way to discover or respond to the situation.

AVINYA introduces a **community-response layer** between the emergency and professional services.

---

# 💡 Our Solution

AVINYA enables a bystander to:

1.  Report an emergency
2.  Share their current location
3.  Optionally provide additional information or media
4.  Find nearby verified responders
5.  Receive real-time response updates
6.  Access relevant first-aid guidance
7.  Continue relying on official emergency services when required

The platform is designed to **complement—not replace—official emergency response systems.**

# 🧠 Responder Matching

AVINYA uses a location-based matching mechanism to identify suitable responders.

                       Find Available Help
```

The system uses geographic distance calculations to identify nearby responders and estimates straight-line distance/ETA for the MVP.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js
* npm
* Git

Check your versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/samyakjain8431-cyber/AVINYA-2026.git
cd AVINYA-2026
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

npm install
```

---

## 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

<!-- TODO: Verify whether the project requires a separate backend command -->

If the backend runs separately, start it according to the project's current scripts/configuration.

---

# 🔌 API

The backend exposes endpoints for emergency management, responder operations, and related functionality.

### Emergency

```text
POST   /api/emergencies
GET    /api/emergencies/:id
PATCH  /api/emergencies/:id/accept
```

### Responders

```text
GET    /api/responders
GET    /api/responders/:id
PATCH  /api/responders/:id/location
```

> Refer to the backend implementation for the complete and current API surface.

# 🔐 Security & Production Considerations

AVINYA is currently an **MVP intended for demonstration and hackathon evaluation**.

Before production deployment, the following areas require additional engineering:

*  Authentication and authorization
*  Role-based access control
*  Encryption of sensitive information
*  Audit logging
*  Secure file-upload validation
*  Location privacy controls
*  Rate limiting and abuse prevention
*  CAPTCHA / bot protection where appropriate
*  Stronger responder identity verification
*  Integration with official emergency services
*  Push notifications
*  Road-network routing and traffic-aware ETA
*  Production monitoring and observability
*  Privacy, safety, and regulatory review

---

# ⚠️ Important

AVINYA is **not a replacement for official emergency services, ambulances, doctors, or emergency dispatch systems.**

It is a prototype exploring how verified community responders could provide an additional layer of assistance while professional help is being arranged.

For real emergencies, contact the appropriate official emergency service.
