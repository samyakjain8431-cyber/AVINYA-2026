## 🚨 About the Project

> **⏱️ Every minute matters.** In a medical emergency, the gap between incident and professional help can mean everything.

A bystander may not know how to provide first aid — yet a qualified person nearby (a doctor, medical student, or trained volunteer) may be completely unaware the emergency is happening.

Traditional emergency response focuses on connecting people to professional services. But a **critical time gap** often exists between the **incident** and the **arrival of professional help**.

### 💡 AVINYA-2026 bridges this gap.

AVINYA is a **community-assisted emergency response platform**. When someone hits **[🚨 Send Emergency Alert](#)**, the platform instantly notifies **nearby verified responders** — doctors, medical students, and trained volunteers — who can reach the scene sooner and provide appropriate assistance while professional help is on the way.

---

# ✨ Why AVINYA?

### 🚑 Faster Local Assistance

Professional emergency services may take time to reach an incident.

AVINYA creates an additional layer of support by identifying **nearby available responders** who can be alerted to the emergency.

---

### 👨‍⚕️ Trusted Responder Network

Anyone should not be able to respond to a medical emergency through the platform.

Doctors, medical students, and approved volunteers undergo a **registration and verification process** before becoming eligible to receive emergency requests.

---

### 📍 Location-Aware Response

The emergency location is a critical part of the response.

AVINYA uses the incident location to identify responders in the surrounding area and help them reach the emergency site.

---

### 🔔 Real-Time Alerts

Instead of relying on a person to discover an emergency manually, the platform sends emergency requests to suitable nearby responders.

This turns the responder network into an **active, location-aware support system**.

---

### 🧠 Assistance While Waiting

The platform can provide emergency-specific first-aid guidance to the bystander, helping them take appropriate immediate steps while assistance is being arranged.

> AVINYA is designed as an **assistance and coordination platform**, not a replacement for professional medical care.

# 🧠 Response Engine

The response engine is the core of AVINYA.

When an emergency is created, the system:

```text
Emergency Created
       │
       ▼
Get Emergency Location
       │
       ▼
Find Available Verified Responders
       │
       ▼
Check Proximity / Estimated Travel Time
       │
       ▼
Send Alert
       │
       ├──────────────► Responder Accepts
       │                         │
       │                         ▼
       │                  Response Started
       │
       └──────────────► No Acceptance
                                 │
                                 ▼
                         Expand Search Radius
                                 │
                                 ▼
                         Alert More Responders
```

The system is designed so that **availability and estimated travel time** can be considered along with distance when selecting responders.

---

# 👨‍⚕️ Responder Verification

AVINYA separates **responder registration** from normal emergency usage.

### Registration Flow

```text
┌────────────────────┐
│ Responder Registers│
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Identity /         │
│ Credential Details │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Verification       │
│ Process             │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Admin Review       │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Approved Responder │
└──────────┬─────────┘
           ▼
┌────────────────────┐
│ Eligible for       │
│ Emergency Alerts   │
└────────────────────┘
```

This helps create a responder network based on **verified participation rather than unrestricted access**.

# ⚙️ Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js
* npm
* Git

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thushara-bajimar/AVINYA-2026.git
cd AVINYA-2026
```

---

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

If the frontend and backend have separate package files, install dependencies in their respective directories as configured in the project.

---

## 3️⃣ Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The terminal will display the local development URL.

---

# 🔐 Security & Privacy

AVINYA handles emergency and responder-related information carefully.

The system is designed around:

* ✅ Verified responder access
* ✅ Controlled responder registration
* ✅ Restricted emergency information
* ✅ Camera-based identity verification
* ✅ Separation of responder and bystander workflows

### Development Storage

The current MVP is designed for **local development and demonstration**.

Uploaded verification files and development database data are stored in the configured local application environment and should not be treated as production-grade cloud storage.

For production deployment, secure cloud storage, encryption, authentication, access control, auditing, and appropriate data-retention policies would be required.

---

# 🌱 Future Scope

AVINYA can evolve into a larger emergency-response ecosystem.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment

Move from local MVP infrastructure to scalable cloud services.

### 🗺️ Road-Based Routing

Use actual road networks instead of relying only on straight-line geographical distance.

### 🚦 Traffic-Aware ETA

Consider real-time traffic conditions when estimating responder arrival time.

### 📱 Mobile Application

Provide dedicated Android and iOS applications for faster emergency access.

### 🔴 Live Location Sharing

Allow responders and relevant emergency participants to share live movement during an active response.

### 🚑 Emergency Service Integration

Future versions could integrate directly with ambulance and emergency service systems.

### 🏥 Healthcare Integration

Potential integration with hospitals and healthcare providers can be explored in future versions.

### 🌐 Multi-Language Support

Support multiple Indian languages to improve accessibility.

### 📶 Low-Connectivity Support

Optimize emergency communication for areas with unreliable network connectivity.

---

# 🎯 Vision

> **"When an emergency happens, help should not depend only on how quickly an ambulance can arrive."**

AVINYA envisions a connected community where **verified people with relevant training can become an additional layer of emergency support**.

The goal is not to replace ambulances, doctors, or hospitals.

The goal is to **bridge the critical gap before professional help arrives.**
